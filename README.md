crispy-waffle is a webgl-based web 3d library.

This is a project developed in pure WebGL. 

It was started as a toy project to understand computer graphics with WebGL.

The goal is to develop code that is simple and intuitive to use and easy to customize. 

And we want to tell you that WebGL is something that anyone can learn.
